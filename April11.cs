//Today, I learned how math can work in code differently and similar as real life does. For example, 1+1 = 2 in real life. But in code, 1+1=11! A similarity is the BEDMAS application to equations
//in real life and in code. For example the code below uses brackets withing the console.writeline to prioritze fahrenheit - 32 first rather than the multiplication.
int fahrenheit = 94;
Console.WriteLine((fahrenheit - 32) x 0.55555555555);
